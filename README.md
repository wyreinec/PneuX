First prediction of pneumonia based on rontgen picture

Pneumonia is a disease caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi, which makes it difficult for children to breathe because their lungs fill with pus and fluid. Various medical methods can be used to diagnose the onset of this disease, one of which is to perform a chest X-ray accompanied and analyzed visually directly by an expert in the lungs field. The number of doctors in Indonesia is very low compared to the world. The ratio of doctors in Indonesia is the second-lowest in Asia resulting in 2018. About 19,000 children/year or 71 children/hour die from pneumonia in Indonesia. Our research questions are how to enhance the effectiveness of Pneumonia identification using a Machine Learning Algorithm? How do optimize the resources needed to diagnose such disease? What are the similarities and differences between expert-based diagnosing and machine-based diagnosing methods of Pneumonia detection? The reason we make this application is to cut time to be more effective and help health workers in Indonesia.
